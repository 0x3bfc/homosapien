# Decentralized History

Decentralise The Human History!

***There is no evolution without skin in the game, be part of it!***

## Introduction

For centuries, the history of [homosapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens) is controlled by who owns the power. A lot of events in our daily life are not commited to a **single source of truth**. Look at the news agencies, Google, Facebook, or Twitter. All of these mediums are controlling our history. Homosapien repository is a way to enable all parties (minority, majority, or any ethnic group) to contribute to sapiens history without any fear of being deleted or slashed. 

Please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/aabdulwahed/descentralized_history_proposal/wiki). If you have any idea or thought about how the human history could be decentralized, don't hesitate to send me a pull request!
